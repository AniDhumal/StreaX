# StreaX Token Project

This is a simple smart contract that manages a basic token system.<br />
The contract is deployed on goerli at 0x2F7B9f18F00ab169D2CB0ea1e4Ea357acF6cCd96 <br />
To test the working of the smart contract:

- install all the required npm modules
- run `npx hardhat test` (runs the tests locally)
  OR
- interact with the contract on goerli at 0x2F7B9f18F00ab169D2CB0ea1e4Ea357acF6cCd96
  OR
- setup your private key in hardhat.config
- setup your alchemy/infura key in hardhat.config
- run `npx hardhat scripts/deploy.js --network goerli` to get your own instance of the token
